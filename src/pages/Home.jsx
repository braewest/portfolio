        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a software engineer specializing in full-stack development and systems-level problem solving. My work spans building production-ready web applications, designing secure backend architectures, and developing performance-critical software. I’ve led technical projects in both academic and real-world environments, including developing immersive educational content in collaboration with NASA and architecting a full-stack platform used for collaborative resource management. I focus on writing maintainable, scalable code, understanding systems end-to-end, and building software that is both technically sound and user-focused.
